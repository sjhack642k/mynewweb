							<h3>Web Marketing</h3>
							<p>Ignoring online marketing is like opening a business but not telling anyone.</p>
							<p>Marketing’s job is never done. It’s about perpetual motion. 
								We must continue to innovate every day.There are three objectives for content marketing: reach engagement conversion. 
								Define key metrics for each.</p>
								
							<p>Web marketing refers to a broad category of advertising that takes many different forms,
								 but generally involves any marketing activity conducted online.

								Marketers have shifted their efforts online because it tends to be significantly less expensive.
								 Many online advertising spaces are free to use. Companies can upload videos to Youtube or start
								  a blog for no cost at all. Other outlets like official websites or paid search marketing cost
								   a fraction of what a major television advertising campaign would.
								
								The web also presents exciting new opportunities for companies to
								 profile their customers. The interactive space of the Internet simplifies 
								 a company's ability to track, store, and analyze data about a customer's 
								 demographics, personal preferences, and online behavior. 
								 This data allows the advertiser to provide a more personalized and relevant ad experience for the customer.</p>

							<h3>Analytics</h3>
							<p>The price of light is less than the cost of darkness.</p>
							<p>A good programmer is someone who always looks both ways before crossing a one-way street. </p>
							<p>Without big data analytics, companies are blind and deaf, 
								wandering out onto the Web like deer on a freeway.</p>
								 <p>Over the past few months I've come across quite a bit of content online
									  regarding tips for web analytics, data analysis, and big data.
									   One of the biggest changes in data analysis over the past decade has been 
									   a shift from primary research to one with more involvement in web analytics.
										Big data needs to be integrated into your data analysis approach. 
										The shift is from "finding enough data" to "not being overwhelmed by the amount of data.
										" Although the analysis process and techniques can prove to be very different,
										 the goal remains the same - use data to guide strategy and decision-making.</p>

							<p>I am engaged to technology.</p>
							<p>Would you like to have a beautiful and attractive design for your website? 
								I am specializing in website Development,So Hire me!!</p>
							<p>So what is UX design all about? So what is UX design all about? 
								Good UX design is all about putting the user first. Any aspect of a website,
								 app or software that doesn’t consider the user’s needs is ultimately doomed to fail.
								  A huge part of the UX design process is getting to know your target audience: 
								  what are their goals? What are their challenges? What motivates them, and how do they move? 
								  The entire product should be built for these people, so don’t even think about opening Sketch until
								   you’ve done your user research.
								 You can learn how to conduct user experience research like a professional here.
							</p>
							
								 <p>Simplicity is everything when it comes to great UX. As Albert Einstein famously said,
									  “Any darn fool can make something complex; it takes a genius to make something simple.” 
									  The user experience of any product should be as straightforward as possible; 
									  as soon as the user lands on a website or opens an app, they should be able to navigate
									   from A to B without even thinking about it. Great UX design is about simplifying the user journey —
									  and this means getting rid of all and any elements that aren’t absolutely necessary.</p>

						<p>“Entrepreneurs Are Great At Dealing With Uncertainty And Also Very Good At Minimizing Risk. That’s The Classic Entrepreneur.”</p>
						<p>This line always puts a smile on my face because it alludes to the excitement of not knowing what to expect but seeing a possible life-changing outcome.</p>
